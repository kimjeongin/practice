Neural Networks Overview

Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks. They consist of nodes (neurons) connected by edges (synapses).

Key Components:
- Input Layer: Receives data
- Hidden Layers: Process information
- Output Layer: Produces results
- Weights and Biases: Parameters that are learned

Training Process:
1. Forward propagation
2. Loss calculation  
3. Backpropagation
4. Weight updates

Deep learning uses neural networks with many hidden layers to learn complex patterns in data.

Applications include image recognition, speech processing, and language translation.

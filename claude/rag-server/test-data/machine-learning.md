# Machine Learning Basics

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed. 

## Types of Machine Learning

1. **Supervised Learning**: Learning with labeled data
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data  
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through trial and error

## Common Algorithms

- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Neural Networks
- Support Vector Machines

Machine learning has applications in many fields including computer vision, natural language processing, and recommendation systems.

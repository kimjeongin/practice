This is a test document for RAG system testing.

The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system is designed to combine information retrieval with text generation. It works by:

1. Indexing documents into a vector database
2. Retrieving relevant chunks based on semantic similarity
3. Using the retrieved context to generate responses

Key features:
- Semantic search using embeddings
- Hybrid search combining keyword and vector search
- Document chunking and metadata management
- Real-time file monitoring and indexing

This document will be used to test the ChromaDB integration and search functionality.

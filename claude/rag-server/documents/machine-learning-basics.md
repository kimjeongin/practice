# Machine Learning Basics

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed for every task.

## Types of Machine Learning

### 1. Supervised Learning
- Uses labeled training data
- Examples: Classification, Regression
- Algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
- Works with unlabeled data
- Examples: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction
- Algorithms: K-Means, PCA, DBSCAN

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
- Learns through interaction with environment
- Examples: Game playing, Robotics
- Algorithms: Q-Learning, Policy Gradient

## Key Concepts

### Training Data
The dataset used to teach the machine learning model. Quality and quantity of training data significantly impact model performance.

### Features
Individual measurable properties of observed phenomena. Good feature selection is crucial for model success.

### Model Evaluation
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct predictions
- **Precision**: True positives / (True positives + False positives)
- **Recall**: True positives / (True positives + False negatives)
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall

## Popular Libraries

- **Python**: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras
- **R**: caret, randomForest, e1071
- **JavaScript**: TensorFlow.js, ML.js

## Best Practices

1. Start with simple models before complex ones
2. Always validate your model on unseen data
3. Address overfitting through regularization
4. Ensure data quality and preprocessing
5. Document your experiments and results

Python Programming Fundamentals

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It's widely used in web development, data science, automation, and artificial intelligence.

BASIC SYNTAX

Variables and Data Types:
- Integers: age = 25
- Floats: price = 19.99
- Strings: name = "Python"
- Booleans: is_active = True
- Lists: fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
- Dictionaries: person = {"name": "John", "age": 30}

Control Structures:
- If statements: if condition: # do something
- For loops: for item in list: # process item
- While loops: while condition: # repeat action

Functions:
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

Classes:
class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand):
        self.brand = brand
    
    def start(self):
        print(f"{self.brand} is starting")

POPULAR LIBRARIES

Data Science:
- NumPy: Numerical computing
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
- Matplotlib: Data visualization
- Seaborn: Statistical visualization
- Scikit-learn: Machine learning

Web Development:
- Django: Full-featured web framework
- Flask: Lightweight web framework
- FastAPI: Modern, fast API framework

Automation:
- Requests: HTTP library
- BeautifulSoup: Web scraping
- Selenium: Browser automation

BEST PRACTICES

1. Follow PEP 8 style guide
2. Use meaningful variable names
3. Write docstrings for functions
4. Handle exceptions properly
5. Use virtual environments
6. Write unit tests

COMMON PATTERNS

List Comprehensions:
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]

Context Managers:
with open("file.txt", "r") as f:
    content = f.read()

Decorators:
@property
def full_name(self):
    return f"{self.first_name} {self.last_name}"

Error Handling:
try:
    result = risky_operation()
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
finally:
    cleanup()

PERFORMANCE TIPS

1. Use built-in functions when possible
2. Prefer list comprehensions over loops
3. Use generators for large datasets
4. Profile your code to find bottlenecks
5. Consider using NumPy for numerical operations

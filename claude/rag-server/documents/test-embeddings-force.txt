Python is a versatile programming language used in web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and automation.

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

Key machine learning concepts include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning algorithms.

Deep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers to process complex patterns in data for tasks like image recognition and natural language processing.

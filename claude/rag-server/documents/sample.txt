This is a sample document for the RAG MCP Server.

The server supports automatic indexing of documents placed in the data directory.
It uses LlamaIndex.js for semantic search and retrieval augmented generation.

Key features include:
- File monitoring with chokidar
- SQLite database for metadata storage
- HuggingFace embeddings for local processing
- MCP protocol implementation
- RESTful API endpoints

You can add more documents to this directory and they will be automatically indexed.
Supported formats include .txt, .md, .json, .xml, .html, and .csv files.

This sample file will help you test the search functionality once the server is running.

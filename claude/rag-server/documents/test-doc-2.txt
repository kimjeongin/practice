Neural Networks and Deep Learning

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to model and understand complex patterns in data.

Neural Network Components:
- Input layer: Receives raw data
- Hidden layers: Process information through weighted connections
- Output layer: Produces final predictions
- Activation functions: Introduce non-linearity
- Weights and biases: Parameters learned during training

Types of Neural Networks:
1. Feedforward Neural Networks
2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)  
3. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
4. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
5. Transformer networks

Applications:
- Image recognition and computer vision
- Natural language processing
- Speech recognition
- Autonomous vehicles
- Medical diagnosis
- Recommendation systems

Deep learning has revolutionized many fields by automatically learning hierarchical representations from raw data.

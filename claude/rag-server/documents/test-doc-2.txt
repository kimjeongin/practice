Test Document 2 - Migration Testing

This document tests embedding model migration functionality.

Key Features Being Tested:
1. Embedding metadata tracking
2. Model compatibility checking  
3. Automatic vector store clearing
4. Re-embedding with new model
5. Database synchronization

The RAG system should handle model changes gracefully without losing document data.
